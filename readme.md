# Incubator

The project is an incubator - it contains different modules and serves different purposes.

- anti-examples showcase aka via-negativa: there are 1001 way to shoot yourself in the foot, but only a few to do according expectations;
- pieces of apps' skeletons;
- if you gaze long into an abyss...: jobs change, this project stays: over time I internalized this gallery of snippets in form of runnable code;
- early stage projects: once a project is mature enough, I extract it into a separate project;
- atomic koans - predict what will be printed or fix something.

# Structure

The project heavily relies on UUIDs as package names.

This might be a ugly, but eliminates the burden of coming up and then supporting package names.

I'm focused on delivering much value with less boilerplate.

Anyway, modules names give the whole idea what's inside.
