# Incubator

The project is an incubator - it contains different modules and serves different purposes.

Mind palace: jobs change, this project stays: over time I internalized this gallery of snippets in form of runnable code.

Early stage projects are here as well - later I extract into a separate project when matured enough. Or return back dead projects to serve as the examples.

Pieces of an app skeleton are included as well.

Apart from that, there are a bit more complex, but still atomic MVP examples.

Finally, there are atomic koans. Predict what will be printed or fix something.

# Structure

The project heavily relies on UUIDs as package names. This might be a ugly, but eliminates the burden of coming up with names instead of focusing on examples value.

Anyway, modules names in general give the whole idea what's inside
