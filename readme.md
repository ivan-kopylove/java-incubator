# Incubator

The project is an incubator - it contains different modules and serves different purposes.

- a mind palace: jobs change, this project stays: over time I internalized this gallery of snippets in form of runnable code;
- aerly stage projects - once a project is mature enough, I extract into a separate project when matured enough. Or return back dead projects to serve as the examples;
- pieces of an app skeletons;
- a bit more complex, but still atomic MVP examples;
- atomic koans - predict what will be printed or fix something.

# Structure

The project heavily relies on UUIDs as package names.

This might be a ugly, but eliminates the burden of coming up and then supporting package names.

I'm focused on delivering much value with less boilerplate.

Anyway, modules names give the whole idea what's inside.
