The project is an incubator, it contains different modules and serves different purposes:

- jobs change, this project stays - over time the examples are internalized; 
- early stage projects - to be extracted into a separate project when matured enough;
- atomic examples;
- atomic koans:
  - what will be printed; 
  - fixmes;
