The project is an incubator - it contains different modules and serves different purposes.

Jobs change, this project stays: over time the examples are internalized and the project became a gallery of snippets in form of runnable code.

Early stage projects are here as well - to be extracted into a separate project when matured enough. Or return back dead projects to serve as examples.

Pieces of an app skeleton are included as well.

Apart from that, there are a bit more complex, but still atomic examples.

Finally, there are atomic koans. Predict what will be printed and Fixmes.
